- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... my dating life (currently in the grave rn)

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ... he/him/his/she/her/hers/it/its/they/them/theirs/xie/xeif/xiesh/gayme/gaymer/gaymers/
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... i have a webbed toe on my right foot between the 2nd and 3rd toe.

I commited a lot of changes. and all of them are getting rid of the pac-man audio files. Pacman is broken rn and i have no idea with no plans to fix it
